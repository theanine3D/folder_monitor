### Installation
You can download a compiled binary from the Releases page. This is the easiest method, as it requires no installation. The executable is fully portable and can be placed anywhere on your hard drive.

Alternatively, you can download the source code and run the Python file via the command line. You will need to first install pySimpleGUI via the command:
```
pip install pysimplegui
```
and then open a command prompt and use the command:
```
python folder_monitor.py
```
